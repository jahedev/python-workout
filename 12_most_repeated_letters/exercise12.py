"""
Write a function, most_repeating_word, that takes a sequence of strings as input. The function should return the string that contains the greatest number of repeated let- ters. In other words
  * For each word, find the letter that appears the most times.
  * Find the word whose most-repeated letter appears more than any other.
That is, if words is set to
words = ['this', 'is', 'an', 'elementary', 'test', 'example']
then your function should return elementary. Thatâ€™s because
  * this has no repeating letters.
  * is has no repeating letters.
  * an has no repeating letters.
  * elementary has one repeating letter, e, which appears three times.  
  * test has one repeating letter, t, which appears twice.
  * example has one repeating letter, e, which appears twice.
